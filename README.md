## Boston Public Schools Bus Routing Scoreboard

*Credits*: Will Eger (Strategic Project Manager, Boston Public Schools)

### Description

The Boston Public Schools recently organized a [challenge](https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/transportationchallenge) focused on reducing the cost of running a fleet of school buses to transport students to and from school every day. While the initial contest is now over, they are interested in maintaining a continuous version of the challenge that allows anyone to submit candidate solutions for evaluation and scoring. This requires the creation of an interactive website that provides a copy of the challenge data, allows users to submit their candidate solutions, and keeps track of the best solutions on a scoreboard.

This project requires the assembly of a front-end website that can parse and display an Excel spreadsheet, run an algorithm to validate and evaluate the submitted data in a performant way, display the submitted data and results visually, and display an up-to-date scoreboard. It also requires the assembly of a back-end service that maintains the score data and potentially supports user registration and login.
